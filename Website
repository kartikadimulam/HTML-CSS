		<p id="biotwo">Although I would love to have a job, I have a lot to learn, so I am still in school. My favorite subjects
are math, science, and history. Aside from school, I am still searching for my personal passion in Mathematics, Science, or Engineering. 
Coding through websites such as Codecademy. This is the first of hopefully more projects</p>


	<h2 id="moreaboutinterests">More About My interests</h2>
		<p id='biothree'>My main hobby since I was young has probably always been basketball. I started playing basketball when I was 7, and I have loved it since.
From playing in my backyard for fun, to playing off the bench on my school team, to being the leader of my own team, I have come a long way, and I 
am always pushing myself to be better. Another recent hobby for me has been music. I started playing the tuba this school year, and I really enjoy it.
So far I have only had two major performances, but I hope to continue in High School. Learning is not really a generic hobby, but I enjoy learning new 
things, such as learning to code, even if it is frustrating in the beginning. This is the first coding project I have done myself, so there is a lot that could be better. I 
know that I will continue to pursue this interest, and keep getting better at it.</p>
